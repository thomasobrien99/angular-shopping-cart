  Need to include $httpProvider in routes 

  We have access to $httpProvider.interceptors, to which you add an interceptor(service)
  Each interceptor has 4 keys: Request, Response, Request Error, Response Error;

  Each key corresponds to a function that returns a promise
  
  Any good response code will trigger the response function

  Any status code 400 and above will trigger the responseError function; --> then logout or redirect.

  try{
    is decoded defined?
    if no throw error
    is(req.params.id === )
  }
  catch{
  	catch error, 
  }
